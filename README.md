In 2019, I stumbled across Bruno Simon's portfolio website. Until that moment, I had no idea you could create experiences like that on the web. It was captivating and delightful. For the past few years, as I've thought about creating my own portfolio website, the idea of having my own 3D portfolio has been top of mind. Over the past year, I've learned a whole host of new technologies that aren't in the wheelhouse of my day job. I've gained a new respect for frontend engineering, and I've been fascinated by the nuance of building applications like these. 

Earlier this year I released a closed beta to a select few users. Their feedback revealed that I would need to make large changes to the level and the code base to account for their feedback. This project is still under active development. You can see some renders of the final site below.
