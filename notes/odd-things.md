# One model with two materials gets position at origin regardless of position settings
I noticed with the monument, even though it works with the generic area, it's position would be the center. I really don't know why the two materials would work at all. I saw the same thing on homelab and a lot of its components. All joined to one mesh with different materials made them all have positions at the center

I've got it working now, but that's something weird to look at in the future if you ever have time.
