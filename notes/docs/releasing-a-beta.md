# Rleasing a beta
After a month or so of working on this project, I had a few thoughts. What if my assumptions about how people will interact with this thing are wrong? What if there are bugs I can't find? What features are really important to focus on? I had an ever growing list of features to implement, but not a clear priority on any one of them. I decided it would be good to get real people using the project and use their feedback to guide the final development of the project. 

Boy was that a good idea! Going into this idea, I thought I would be able to predict what my users would find, but what they valued and what I valued were extremely different. I thought people were going to notice how the colors looked a little off, or that the physics didn't quite work right, or any number of critiscisms of the minute details that aren't quite perfect. 

Nope!

What happened instead, is most people loaded the site and their immediate thought was "What's the point?"

"What do you mean what's the point?!"

Then users tried to move the player. Most users were on mobile, and even though I had an option for mobile use, I didn't do any experience testing on mobile. I had no idea what it would look like or what it was like to move the rabbit. That was a big mistake. The mobile controls were clunky and unresponsive. Most people reported that they were extremely unintuitive. Most users didn't even see that there were controls on mobile. 

If a user was able to move around, there next comment was that the camera was very awkward and they found themselves wanting to move the view at their disgression. This didn't surprise me a ton. Given that I was trying to get something releaseed I didn't put a ton of work into the camera system. Trust me I did for the full release **TODO LINK TO CAMERA SYSTEM DESIGN**. 

And for the exceptional few that were able to get to the rocket launch scene and set it off. They wanted to be able to reset it. They REALLY wanted to be able to reset it. 

Oh and did anyone complain about the colors or the details of the models? Not one. 

## Work after
After the beta, I knew the features I would have to prioritize. I set out to complete the following before a full release:

- Rework the camera system to both give the user a better view while moving around, and alow them to control the camera if they wanted to
- Add a title screen that makes it immediately apparent to the user what the "point" of the site is.
- Reworking the mobile controls to be responsive and intuitive. Also plan to include a small helper on the site.
- Rethink the narrative flow of the experience.
- Adding the ability to reset the launch animation.

**TODO LINKS TO ALL**
