# Getting started
I followed Bruno's instruction for the first time using Blender. This is the first model I made. It's supposed to be a cheeseburger XD **TODO CHEESEBURGER RENDER**. 

From there, the ThreeJS course instructed me how to make these scene **TODO PORTAL RENDER**. If you like you can actually view this site here: **TODO LINK TO PORTAL SITE**

After I completed the portal exercise I felt I had enough foundation to create models in blender. 

## ASU Model
To keep with the garden theme, I wanted something that showed fauna of arizona and showed the university. Enter cacti and moutains! I had originally envisioned getting an exact model of A mountain at the Tempe campus. This was one of many ideas that was just too complex for what I was going for. That's a lot of polygons to render. That's a lot of detail to give unnecessary labor over. I decided instead to create a 3D ASU logo, prop it up on some rocks, soround it with cacti, and add some palm trees around as an homage to Palm Walk. I also took the time to create the graduation cap you see in the corner. That was the first complex model I made. It was a good time.

## Phoenix Cubesat
These models represent an amazing project I had the oppurtunity to work on in school. Can you believe a team of students got to build a satellite with an imaging payload!? And I got to head up software for that!? Amazing experience. 

So of course I make a model of our satellite, but while spacecraft do have a certain beauty to them, I didn't feel it really communicated what I was after. So I took the time to convert our logo into a model (**TODO SHOUTOUT TO WHO? FOR THE LOGO DESIGN**). 

If you look closely, you'll see that the details of the logo are all defined and the logo is a bit of a relief. While this is a neat affect, this has some major downsides.

This model was very difficult to create. The only way I knew to make complex curves like that in blender, at the time, was to extrude each point along the curves individually. Then sepearate all the meshes, and assign materials to the different faces manually. That was a ton of work, and it created a very heavy model.

This model has a total of **TODO HOW MANY POINTS, FACES**. That's a lot to load for not a lot of benefit. If I was to do this again, I would've created a very simple mesh in the outline of the logo, then wrap the logo around the mesh.

## Rocket and launch complex
Another exercise in keeping things simple. Take a look at some of these reference images. **TODO REF IMAGES OF COMPLEX**. Originally I wanted to show the water tower, get a lot of detail on the platform, have a whole flame trench and everything. I realized after making just the cradle that I should prioritize what I'm trying to communicate. I'm trying to get across the essence of "Wow a launch" not "Wow all that minute detail". I kept the rocket, the cradle, and made a lot of liberty with the flame trench. Read about how I designed and built the launch scene here **TODO LINK TO LAUNCH SCENE EXPLANATION**.  

I later figured out how to wrap the rocket in a custom UV map to get the logos on. I wanted to show all the logos, but I don't want to have to reach out to Lockheed and NASA for approval to use their logos. The logos aren't true to life, but they get the important information across.

## Vanguard
After school, I went back to the east and worked with the Vanguard Group. I did several different developer tasks in multiple sections of the business. The majority of my work though was with AWS products. Anyone ho knows their services will know these from the logos.

Funny enough, I made this model very recently. I had gotten a lot of experience by the time I made this and I was able to make the entire thing in just under an hour.

## U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
Of all my models, this one probably communicates the least about my work in this position. That's by design. I work on classified programs where it would be inappropriate for me to decide what I can and cannot express to the general public about the projects I work on. There is a world where I could make a model, get it approved to be released to the public, but that's much more hassle than I want to bring into this project. And let's say I want to change the model. I have to get the new revision approved separately.

I decided instead to put an iconic building from the Washington D.C. campus as my model. And the best part, the model's details are reconstructed solely from images on google and the model available on Google Earth. Sorry, no insider secrets to be found here.

## Homelab
Before this project became my sole hobby, I enjoyed working on homelabbing. This is where you set up enterprise grade software and networking solutions in the home. Now you may rightly ask, "Craig, why would you want to be your own IT guy." Friend, that's a fantastic question. When I find an answer, I'll let you know. 

In all honesty, it's fun to experiment with enterprise software, it gives me good networking troubleshooting skills for work, and it honestly feels like a bit of a super power to stand up any solution you desire.

For the model, I wanted to express the server aspect and also the technologies I enjoyed using. I thinking it comes across pretty well. 

**TODO RENDER OF HOMELAB**

## The Rabbit Hole
It's incredibly satsifying to see this concept realized. Having an actual rabbit hole that the user can go down is one of the original ideas that I stuck to. To build this, I used proportional editioning to give a hill to this plane. Then I deleted a few planes out of the hill, and joined a circle underneath the hill. Some proportial edits later and you have a hole. Then add a UV unwrapped circular plane and you have the template for a rabbit hole portal

## Bushes
If you look closely, there's only about 3 or 4 different bush and stem styles scattered about the site. Like most of my models I had originally planned to make these much more complicated, but saner minds prevailed. I love the way they turned out.
