# The project
Somewhere around 2020, I stumbled across an incredible website. www.bruno-simon.net. Bruno Simon's portfolio website, but more than that, a 3D experience on the web. I was blown away by the creativity captured in that site. The way he shared his experience in such an engaging and unique way captivated me. All these years later and it sticks out to me as the most unique websites I've ever seen. I've wanted to create a website like that ever since.

Ever sense I graduated school, I wanted to create a portfolio website. Somewhere to write about my journey growing as a software engineer. Somwhere to publish my own little research projects. Even if no one read it I wanted the satisfaction of having my work online. Through the last few years I've debated back and forth on what my own website could do. My own little corner of the internet. I've always been daunted though by this challenge. Come July of 2023, I decided to take the plunge and create my own interactive portfolio. 

This project is ongoing. It is simultaneously the most challenging and satisfying personal project I've ever worked on. The problems it presents are delightful. The technologies exposed to me are thought provoking, and the satisfaction of being able to understand technologies that I didn't before, and but them all together to make something beautiful is awesome. 

On this temporary website, you can read about my progress, thought process, and lessons learned tackling this project.

## Design Philosophy
In Bruno's site, I loved his showcase of his hobbies, career, and contact information. I wanted similar elements in my site, but I didn't want to just clone his website with my own models. I wanted something unique to me. 

I see this site as an expression of myself. It's my little corner of the internet. I thought about the type of environment I would like to welcome visitors into. A library? A study? A garden? Oh, and then if I had a garden, I could pay an homage to a good friend of mine and have users control a rabbit. And then if I could have a rabbit, I could have a rabbit hole XD! And then users could go down the rabbit hole! It was this train of thought that hooked me. The delight in crafting these experiences in my mind was cool. The time from ideation to implementation is much more than I thought, but to see your imagination come to life in front of you is magical. 

Below, you can see the initial design for my site layout, the layout used in beta, and the layout used for the final version. **TODO INSERT SITE LAYOUT, BETA LAYOUT, V1 LAYOUT**

## Technologies
This project exposed me to my first of many. This was my first time:

- Building a website
- Using Javascript
- Using Blender
- Using React
- Building 3D models
- Making real design decisions influenced by performance constraints
- Making a thing for real users and getting feedback from them!


## Thanks to creators for their models
I created most of the models you see, but there are a few that I'd like to take a moment ot credit:

- The tree above the rabbit hole: **TODO SOURCE**
- The rabbit and it's animations: **TODO SOURCE**
- The mailbox, letters, github model, linkedin model, and google maps pin are all reused from Bruno Simon's site with his permission.
- The rocks: **TODO SOURCE**
