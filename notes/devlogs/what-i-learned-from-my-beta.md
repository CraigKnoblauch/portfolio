# What I learned from releasing a beta
TODO:

- [ ] Record
- [ ] Edit & Release

## Outline
### Introduction to the project
- Inspired by Bruno Simon's portfolio
- Wanting to make something like that for myself
- Believing that we should all have little corners of the internet that are uniquely ours. 
- Welcoming people to my site and what that would mean 

### Setting out to build it
- Took Bruno Simon's ThreeJS course. Insane quality, link below
- Learned blender, React Three Fiber, Javascript, React
- Didn't realize how much time it would take
- Began to worry that I would realease something that was inadvertently buggy (there's this funny thing in software development where users will find things you can't see)
- Decided to limit the scope for a beta, and release to friends and family for feedback

### What I did to prepare
- Set up a google form
- Gave people only the smallest context. As much as someone who was linked the page would have.

### What I thought people would say
- The physics are a little wonky
- The foliage has a beige sheen to it
- The homelab platform is floating

### What people actually said
- What's the point
- Can't figure out the controls
- Can't move the camera
- Tried to click on your papers
- The bunny can't jump
- My mom actually found a way out of the map

### Understanding and responding to their feedback
- Most people were on mobile, what they saw. So now they would see this
- Addressing 'what's the poing' with an introduction page and a swoop down to the site
- The mobile controls were very bad. I only tested the mobile controls on a browser, never in my hand. Addressing that with a small on screen tutorial and of course making the feedback of the controls smoother
- Redesigning the site to have more of a flow.
- I knew the camera dynamics weren't great, but I knew what was outside the camera's view, others didn't. I designed an entire camera system to compensate for this. Stay tuned for an additional vide about that.

### What I learned
- Good thing I did tihs and didn't release when it was "done".
- If people are evenly mildly annoyned by a website they won't stay to stick it out.
- Your users will care about things that you don't. They'll ask questions you wouldn't. 
- Make sure you test rigorously with the platform most of your users will be on. All I can say is that I at least knew it worked on mobile, but I didn't have a dedicated mobile experience in mind.
